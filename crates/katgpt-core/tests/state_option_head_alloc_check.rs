//! Plan 607 T3 G4 — zero-alloc steady state for the fitted head's DECISION
//! path (FittedHead::pick + score over a live decision set). Separate
//! single-path binary so the counting allocator picks up ONLY this path's
//! allocations (parallel lib tests would corrupt the deltas — the
//! bench-655 convention).
//!
//! Scope note (honest by construction): `HeadFitter` allocates its D×D
//! scratch ONCE at construction — that is the cold fit path, deliberately
//! OUT of this window. The G4 claim is the per-decision hot loop: the
//! head's score/pick are stack-local f64 folds.
