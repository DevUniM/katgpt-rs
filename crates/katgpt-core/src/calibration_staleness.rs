//! Calibration staleness at the freeze/thaw seam (Issue 841 §B-3).
//!
//! # The defect this refuses
//!
//! A calibration head — a Platt temperature/bias pair, a per-head attention
//! scale table, a conformal residual pool — is fitted against ONE set of
//! weights. [`AGENTS.md`'s modelless mandate](../../../AGENTS.md) permits
//! exactly three runtime weight mutations, and the first of them is
//! **freeze/thaw**: swapping a frozen snapshot. The moment that swap lands,
//! every attached calibration is describing weights that are no longer there.
//!
//! Nothing in the stack noticed. `SigmoidGateCalibrator::apply` returns an
//! `f32`; `StaticCalTable::get_scale` returns an `f32`; a conformal interval
//! comes back with its `alpha` intact. A stale calibration does not produce a
//! NaN, an error, or an implausible number — it produces a **confident wrong
//! one**, which is the silent direction and the reason this is a refusal
//! rather than a warning.
//!
//! The doctrine is already written in this repo, one domain over:
//! `katgpt_dec::types::invalidate_coboundary_cache` — *"every mutation path
//! invalidates every topology-derived invariant"*. A calibration is a
//! weights-derived invariant. The seam is the same.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! [`SnapshotBound<T>`] binds a calibration to the [`SnapshotId`] it was
//! fitted under and will not hand it back once that identity moves:
//! [`SnapshotBound::get`] returns `None`, and warns **once per binding**.
//!
//! ⛔ `None` is the whole point. An API that returned a *default* calibration
//! on staleness (the `StreamingTauCalibrator` cold-start shape — fall back to
//! `DEFAULT_TAU_LO`) is right for a cold start and wrong here: a cold start
//! has no fitted claim to be wrong about, and a stale head does. The caller
//! must decide to refit, abstain, or run uncalibrated. This primitive refuses
//! to decide that for them, which is the `CalibratedPolicy::fell_back`
//! precedent — *"the caller is told, not protected by accident"*.
//!
//! # The predicate
//!
//! Generalised from `DefaultMpiRouterSnapshotHook::cache_valid`
//! (`katgpt-spectral`), the one shipped version-keyed invalidation at a swap
//! boundary, whose two rules are both load-bearing and are kept verbatim:
//!
//! 1. **`version == 0` is never fresh.** A caller that has not wired a
//!    generation counter gets [`Staleness::Unversioned`] and `None`, not a
//!    plausible score. The unwired caller is exactly the one this exists for,
//!    so the default must be refusal — a zero that meant "fine" would make
//!    adoption look like a no-op.
//! 2. **The commitment is re-checked even when the version matches.** That
//!    catches the caller bug the version alone cannot see: weights swapped,
//!    generation not bumped. It is reported as its own
//!    [`Staleness::CommitmentMoved`] rather than pooled into `VersionMoved`,
//!    because the two need opposite repairs — one is a stale calibration, the
//!    other is a broken bump site.
//!
//! ⚠ **What this does NOT claim.** It does not detect a calibration that has
//! gone stale for a reason that is not a snapshot swap (distribution drift,
//! a changed prompt mix, a tokenizer change). Those are a different class and
//! this returning `Some` is not evidence of freshness — only that the
//! *snapshot identity* is unchanged. It also cannot invalidate a calibration
//! somebody read out of the wrapper with [`SnapshotBound::peek_unchecked`];
//! that method is named to be greppable for exactly that reason.
//!
//! Zero allocation on every path. Opt-in (`calibration_staleness`).
