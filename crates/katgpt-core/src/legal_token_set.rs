//! Legal-token-set enumeration + the restricted-projection decision
//! (Issue 841, grammar-forced vocabulary-projection skip).
//!
//! # The shape of the problem
//!
//! A structural pruner — a grammar, a JSON schema, a DFA over a tool-call
//! syntax — knows its legal continuation set *from its state*. Every consumer
//! in this repo nonetheless asks it the opposite question, one token at a
//! time:
//!
//! ```text
//! for (i, &p) in marginal.iter().enumerate() {          // O(vocab)
//!     if p > 0.0 && horizon.is_valid(depth, i, parents) // O(prefix) each
//! ```
//!
//! With a 32 K vocabulary that is 32 768 predicate calls to discover the ten
//! tokens a grammar would have named directly — and in `build_dd_tree_lodestar`
//! it happens once per heap pop, with `is_valid` re-walking the prefix inside
//! every one of them.
//!
//! [`ConstraintPruner::legal_degree`] + [`ConstraintPruner::for_each_legal`]
//! invert the question. This module supplies the two pieces a pruner needs to
//! answer it and the one decision a projection consumer needs to act on it.
//!
//! [`ConstraintPruner::legal_degree`]: crate::traits::ConstraintPruner::legal_degree
//! [`ConstraintPruner::for_each_legal`]: crate::traits::ConstraintPruner::for_each_legal
//!
//! # What is here
//!
//! - [`CsrLegalSet`] — compressed sparse row over (state → sorted legal
//!   tokens). O(deg) enumeration, O(1) degree, zero allocation on read.
//!   Generalised from the one shipped state→successor enumerator in this
//!   repo, `bisimulation::graph::TransitionGraph` (`adjacency_window` +
//!   `for_each_adjacent`, CSR + callback, allocation-free) — the same shape
//!   over token ids instead of operator labels.
//! - [`ProjectionPlan`] + [`plan_projection`] — how much of the vocabulary
//!   projection a legal set of a given size actually justifies skipping.
//!
//! # ⛔ A small legal set does not always justify a gather
//!
//! The obvious rule — "|L| < V, therefore score only L" — is wrong, and this
//! repo has already measured why. A gathered-row pass over the LM head runs
//! at **20.6 GB/s against 108 GB/s** for the dense contiguous one
//! (`katgpt-forward::cluster_head` module docs, Issue 661), so the crossover
//! is a *fraction of the vocabulary*, not "any saving at all". Issue 661 put
//! the clustered head's own crossover at ~21–34 % active.
//! [`RestrictionPolicy::max_active_fraction`] carries that number as DATA
//! rather than a constant in a branch, and its default is deliberately below
//! the measured band — a gather that ties is a gather that lost, because it
//! also spends the enumeration.
//!
//! [`ProjectionPlan::Forced`] is the exception and is not a bandwidth
//! argument at all: with one legal token the projection cannot change the
//! answer, so the right amount of it to compute is none.
//!
//! # Sync boundary
//!
//! None. Pure structure over caller-owned state; no allocation on any read
//! path; no `Instant`, no RNG, no globals.
