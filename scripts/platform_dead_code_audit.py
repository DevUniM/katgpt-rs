"""The platform-dead_code class — an item declared UNGATED whose every use
sits behind a platform cfg the declaration lacks.

    const NEON_U8: usize = 16;                      // ungated, any platform
    #[cfg(target_arch = "aarch64")]                 // the only use
    unsafe fn neon_is_interval_closed(..) { ..(bytes, NEON_U8) }

On every platform except aarch64 this item is DEAD CODE — rustc says so on
the lanes that compile x86_64, and stays silent on the lanes that compile
aarch64. Five specimens across two repos in two days (riir-clippy intake P22,
2026-09-14), every one caught by a lane NO CI owns:

    katgpt-rs NEON_U8            (fixed ea4c2873 — interval_pruner/simd.rs)
    zed     KEYCHAIN_SERVICE     (fixed a4f70e64a7 — claude_usage.rs)
    zed     war_room_screenshot  (example, macOS-only harness)
    zed     ProcessStatus        (import, unix-only use — reliability.rs)
    zed     util/process.rs test imports (module held only a not-windows test)

katgpt-rs full_gate is macOS/aarch64 (where the aarch64 side compiles and the
item is USED); wasm32_gate is wasm32. The x86_64-native Windows lane that
actually sees the dead_code warning is a workstation lane. The defect is
therefore invisible to every automatic gate this workspace runs.

A REPORT, not a gate (always exit 0) — the population spans repos whose
owners have not taken the intake, and the classifier has honest blind spots
listed under Divergences. The gateable half (a per-repo findings ceiling of
0, the way `cfg_gated_floor_gate.py` pins its family) belongs to the repo
owners after the first sweep adjudicates the row list.

# The rule

For each module-scope declaration (const/static/fn/struct/enum/type/use, incl.
impl/trait-associated items) that is NOT bare `pub` in a library file
(externally reachable items are never dead; `pub` in bin/example/test files
still counts — no external consumer exists, the zed war_room_screenshot
shape), collect every identifier occurrence in the same crate unit (comments,
strings, and attribute interiors masked out). Resolve each occurrence's cfg
context — the conjunction of enclosing item attrs, block attrs (cfg'd
statement blocks included), file-leading `#![cfg]`, and enclosing `mod foo;`
decl gates resolved ACROSS FILES up the directory chain.

A context's PLATFORM ATOMS are the `target_*` / `unix` / `windows` conjuncts
at the top level of its predicates (nested in `all(...)` allowed). A use is
NARROWER than the declaration iff it carries a platform atom (key, value)
where the declaration's context has no atom for that key, or a different
value for it.

FINDING iff the declaration has at least one use and EVERY use is narrower —
on the platforms the declaration compiles but no use does, the item is dead.
Read that as all-uses-gated per-use (each use may gate on a different atom);
the intake's "shares a platform predicate" wording is satisfied a fortiori.

# MOD-REF is a separate bucket and is never folded into the count

A `mod name;` declaration satisfies the rule above and is NOT a rustc
finding. Measured on the first row this audit produced (2026-09-14,
`katgpt-types/src/simd/mod.rs:49`): `mod horizontal;` is ungated and all 15
references to it are `target_arch = "x86_64"`, and `cargo check -p
katgpt-types --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` emits NOTHING — every item
INSIDE that module is itself x86_64-gated, so on wasm32 the module is empty
rather than dead. Appending one ungated `fn` to the same file reproduces the
warning immediately, and it names the FN. So rustc reports dead code at the
ITEM, the items are reached by this audit independently, and a `mod` row is
an upstream observation about where a module is referenced from — a style
nit at most. Pooling it would report that nit at the severity of a dead item,
the pooled-total mistake this workspace documents in three other audits.

# Conservative by construction — the directions that only lose findings

  * a platform atom under `any(...)` or `not(...)` makes the whole context
    UNMODELLED and the use DISQUALIFIES the declaration (it may be alive on
    every platform we care about);
  * `feature = ...`, `test`, `doc`, `debug_assertions` conjuncts are not
    platform atoms — the feature-gated green-zero class is
    cfg_gated_target_audit's territory, not this one;
  * occurrences inside macro bodies/args count as uses (a macro that
    references the item keeps it alive wherever it is invoked);
  * doc-comment mentions are NOT uses (masked) — but an INLINE FORMAT ARG
    is: `println!("n = {NPC_COUNT}")` binds the identifier under Rust 2021,
    so identifiers inside a string's `{...}` groups survive the mask. A
    non-format string containing `{Foo}` therefore yields a phantom use,
    which can only hide;
  * a name declared more than once in a unit (shadowing across modules) is
    skipped outright — occurrences cannot be attributed to one decl;
  * a `pub use` re-export of the name counts as an ungated use wherever the
    re-export itself compiles (an occurrence is an occurrence).

# Divergences (documented)

⛔ The first version of this header claimed "no known direction in which this
INVENTS a finding" and that claim was FALSE on the first sweep it ever ran:
masking string literals dropped Rust 2021 inline format args, and riir-ai's
`SWEEP_COUNTS` — printed ungated at `ane_npc_goat.rs:250` and otherwise used
only under `target_os = "macos"` — read as a finding. Repaired above and
pinned by two self-test arms (format arg / plain mention). The list below is
the set of gaps that have been LOOKED for, not a proof that none remains:
a conservative-by-construction argument is a claim about the code somebody
wrote, and this one was wrong until a real corpus contradicted it.


  (a) same-name locals/params/fields elsewhere count as uses (hides);
  (b) `#[path]`-aliased modules and out-of-tree includes lose their chain
      gates (parentage unresolved -> treated as ungated, hides);
  (c) uses reachable only through macro expansion of OTHER names are
      invisible unless the macro body mentions the name literally (hides);
  (d) a `#[cfg]` on a struct FIELD, an enum VARIANT or a fn PARAMETER is not
      modelled — those are not items to this pass, so a type named only in a
      gated field reads as used from the struct's own context (hides). The
      item HEADER is modelled: a block item's segment is extended back over
      its generics, parameters and return type, which is what makes the
      `fn wait() -> ProcessStatus` import shape reachable at all;
  (e) over-marking risk is the absence of one: every attribution gap above
      points toward fewer findings, never more.

# Validation

`selftest()` pins the classifier on synthetic trees in BOTH directions and
runs on EVERY invocation (exit 2 on any miss — an untrustworthy instrument is
not the same verdict as drift, and a report that cannot classify must not be
read as `0 findings`). `--prove-fires <fix_sha>` extracts `<fix_sha>~1` and
`<fix_sha>` of THIS repo via `git archive` and requires the NEON_U8 row to
fire at the parent and be absent at the fix — the ceiling is never a pin
nobody has watched fail. The four zed specimens live on a box this script
does not run from; they are cited as provenance, never claimed as validated.

⛔ An arm is only a canary if its own perturbation REDS it. Measured on the
three arms this pass added: deleting the format-arg restore reds arm 20,
pooling MOD-REF into findings reds arm 23 — and neutering `vendored_p` red
NOTHING, because the synthetic trees have no `.git` and were taking the
filesystem-walk branch, where a redundant `"vendor"` in SKIP_DIRS was doing
the filtering instead. One exclusion, two code paths, and the arm certified
the path it was not aimed at. Removing the duplicate made it two-sided.

Standing (2026-09-14, this box's 16 of 20 contract repos): **0 findings · 1
MOD-REF** over 8694 tracked `.rs` / 3433 units / 119452 candidate decls, with
the two riir-ai rows from the first sweep repaired and compile-verified —
`note_ane_dispatch` (x86_64 Windows, `--features ane_prefill`) and
`gen_u64_bytes` (wasm32, `--features chacha20_rng`).

# `vendor` is DELIBERATELY not in SKIP_DIRS: it belongs to `vendored_p`, and
# listing it in both made the self-test arm inert — the synthetic trees have no
# `.git`, so they took the rglob path and were filtered by this set no matter
# what `vendored_p` returned. A canary that passes under its own perturbation
# is certifying nothing.
#
# Vendored upstream code is not this workspace's to gate — the same rule and
# the same fork that forced it for the wasm32 surface audit (Issue 738 T3):
# riir-ai tracks a `wgpu-hal-30.0.0` fork whose gles backend is full of
# wasm32-only helpers, and every compile lane in that repo already derives
# its `-p` list with `grep -v '^vendor/'`. Excluded LOUDLY (the count rides
# the per-repo line) rather than silently, because a shrinking walk is how a
# report becomes a confident zero.
