"""The timed-region guard verdict over every contract repo, PINNED (Issue 855 T6).

The per-push half is `timed_region_guard_gate.py`, which gates THIS repo by
MEMBERSHIP over a population Issue 855 T3 executed end to end — 34 regions run,
every pinned row carrying the number somebody MEASURED. That standard cannot be
exported, and T5's own close-out says why:

> a wall in a sibling would be a wall over an unread bucket, which is exactly
> what T4 refused.

⛔ So this is a **RATCHET**, and the ratchet is EARNED rather than assumed.
T5 executed all 33 sibling READ-tier rows (2026-09-19) — 1 UNBUILDABLE, 32 run,
**2 VANISHED (6.3%)** against this repo's own 7 of 34 (20.6%). That is enough
evidence to constrain the DERIVATIVE in somebody else's tree: the commit that
adds ANOTHER unguarded timed region reds, and the rows already there stay their
owners' to adjudicate. It is NOT enough for a membership wall with a reason per
row — 30 of the 32 are single readings taken on a loaded box without T3's 4x
scaling probe, so *fast* and *partly eliminated* are not separated for them.
That residue is stated in Issue 855 and not laundered into a pin here.

⚠ Issue 785's rule is respected rather than skirted. It forbids ratcheting a
bucket whose meaning is *unanswered*; this bucket means *no loud-zero defence*,
every row has an owner, and the population behind the number has been RUN.

Three states it reports and does not gate — all three found by EXECUTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
None is foldable into the guard verdict, and each was invisible to the counting
half of T5:

- **`#[ignore]`d.** `cargo test --exact <fn>` prints `ok. 0 passed; 1 ignored`
  and exits **0** — byte-for-byte this family's own green-zero shape, met
  inside T5's own runner and nearly recorded as a result. The region is then
  neither guarded nor satisfied by absent work; it is UNEXECUTED. Measured: all
  4 riir-chain rows in T5's set, live once re-run with `--ignored`.
- **prints NO number.** The quantity lives only inside an `assert!` message,
  i.e. it is visible ONLY on failure — so *read the printed value next to the
  bar*, the method that found every other row, cannot see it at all. Measured
  as the highest-yield slice by a factor of four: 1 VANISHED of 4 (25%) against
  a population rate of 6.3%.
- **UNBUILDABLE** is NOT reported, because it is not statically decidable and
  this sweep would have to guess. riir-chain's workspace-excluded bridge crate
  cannot resolve its dependencies at all, so its GOAT gate is compiled by
  nothing — a manifest-RESOLUTION property, filed there as `.issues/157`. Named
  here so a later census reads the exclusion instead of re-deriving it.

Two floors, and in 8 of 21 repos NEITHER bites
-----------------------------------------------
`min_files` catches the walk going blind; `min_regions` catches the PREDICATE
going blind over an unchanged walk. They break separately — a `git ls-files`
regression takes the first to 0 with the classifier intact, and a masker or
regex regression takes the second to 0 while the walk is untouched.

⚠ Eight repos have **0 timed regions** and three have **0 tracked test/bench
files**, so both quantities are 0 there and neither detects anything — Issue
783's population shape, stated as a measurement rather than assumed. A reserved
`TOTALS` row floors the population GLOBALLY for exactly that reason, which is
the `wasm32_surface_drift_sweep` answer to the same problem.

Why this is NOT in scripts/docs_gate.sh's CHECKS
------------------------------------------------
Identical to the other sweeps: CI has one checkout, the siblings are simply
absent, so this would either red on every run or derive an EMPTY population and
print a confident green over zero repos.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on drift above the pins, **2 if the instrument itself is
untrustworthy**. `--canary` runs the adversary arms.
