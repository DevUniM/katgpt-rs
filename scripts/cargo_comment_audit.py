"""
Cross-repo Cargo.toml inline-comment auditor.

Catches the drift class where a Cargo feature is transitively in
`default = [...]` (e.g. `micro_belief` is pulled in by `bom_sampling`,
which is in `default`), but the inline comment on the feature line
still claims "Opt-in" / "Default-OFF" / etc. Also catches the inverse
(comment claims default-on but feature is actually opt-in).

This is the Cargo.toml-comment counterpart to bench_doc_audit.py.
Run after every feature promotion to catch comment drift early.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/cargo_comment_audit.py                # audit this repo
    python3 scripts/cargo_comment_audit.py /git/riir-ai   # audit a specific repo
    python3 scripts/cargo_comment_audit.py /git           # walk all repos under /git

Exit code: 0 if no mismatches, 1 if any mismatch found.

Strategy
--------
1. Read every GIT-TRACKED `Cargo.toml` in the repo (falling back to a
   pruned filesystem walk when the target is not a git repo).
2. From each `[features]` table, collect:
   - the set of all defined feature names
   - the set of names transitively enabled by `default = [...]`
   (per-manifest closure, unioned across manifests)
3. For every feature definition line `feat = [...]  # comment`,
   parse the comment for a status phrase (opt-in / default-on / etc).
4. Cross-check: if comment says opt-in but feature is in the default
   closure → MISMATCH. If comment says default-on but feature is not
   in any default closure → MISMATCH.

Status vocabulary
-----------------
Reuses parse_status_phrase from bench_doc_audit — same word boundaries,
same opt-in-default-phrase guard (so "default-off" is not misclassified
as "default" via substring).

Caveats
-------
- Only the comment on the feature-definition line is checked. Multi-line
  comments above the feature line are NOT checked (would require a
  multi-line state machine; out of scope for v1).
- Only features defined in `[features]` tables are checked; package
  metadata comments are ignored.
- A feature is considered "default" if it appears in the default closure
  of ANY Cargo.toml in the repo (cross-crate promotions count).
