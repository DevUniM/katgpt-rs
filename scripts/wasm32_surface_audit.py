"""Which packages carry POSITIVE wasm32 code, and does any lane compile them?

The wasm32 audit family (Issue 737) closed six axes, all of them about *how* a
lane compiles what it names: the triple, the `target_feature` arm, the feature
set, the arm reached via a dependent, the separate workspace, `check`-vs-lints.
This is the seventh axis and it is one level up — **is what the lane names the
whole surface?**

Found in mmorpg-remake (`.issues/010` T2): the root package carried a positive
`#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` block that no row built and, measured, none
*could* — and the block had been uncompilable since it was written, because it
called a function declared `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`.

⛔ The predicate is the POSITIVE cfg. `not(target_arch = "wasm32")` is an
ordinary native-only guard and means the file has NO browser code (riir-ai
`.issues/892` T4); counting it inflates every number here. Comment lines are
excluded too — prose explaining a cfg is not a cfg, and a doc block that
mentions one would otherwise make a file look like browser code.

A **report, not a gate** (exit 0). Two floors are printed rather than pinned:
a ceiling ("0 uncovered") is green over whatever the instrument can see, so
the walk size has to be readable underneath it.

The eighth axis (Issue 774) is the DEPENDENCY EDGE: a row that selects a
package compiles that package's in-repo PATH DEPS for wasm32 too, so a
package with positive cfgs that no row names can still be covered — the
measured case was riir-shader's core+effects, built by every
`-p riir-shader-showcase --target wasm32` bundle build while the row-based
resolver read them UNCOVERED. The fix is a THIRD verdict, `✓ by-dep`:
reached from a named/derived package through non-optional in-repo path-dep
edges (plain `[dependencies]` plus target tables whose cfg positively names
`wasm32`; `workspace = true` entries resolve through the root table).
NEVER folded into NAMED — the distinction is load-bearing: a by-dep
package's lane dies by an innocent dep-graph edit in someone ELSE's
manifest, and the reader must know which kind of coverage they have. The
credit is reachability, not compile-verifiedness — but it is not vacuous
either: a broken wasm32 arm in a by-dep package breaks the named row's own
build the next time that row runs, which is exactly where the 010-class
catch would surface. Deliberately NOT credited: dev/build deps (host-side),
optional deps (feature off in the row), target tables gating to native, and
cross-repo path deps (a sibling's coverage is answered by the sibling's own
run). mmorpg-poc-submodule is the standing negative control: deliberately
excluded from its repo's CI and depended on by nothing, it stays UNCOVERED.

# The row predicate above is DEP-BLIND: `-p riir-shader-showcase --target
# wasm32` compiles the showcase's in-repo path deps too, so riir-shader's
# core+effects read UNCOVERED while every bundle build compiles them
# (measured: `cargo check -p riir-shader-effects --target
# wasm32-unknown-unknown` exits 0, 2026-09-14). The graph below credits
# exactly those edges — as a THIRD verdict, never folded into NAMED: by-dep
# coverage dies by a dep-graph edit in someone else's manifest, and the
# reader must see which kind of coverage they hold.
