"""A tracked `scripts/*.py` naming an attribute a sibling module does not
define — Issue 848.

Python has **no link step**. `import worktree_state` then
`worktree_state.is_checkout(root)` resolves at CALL time, so a rename or a
deletion in the imported module is not an error until somebody EXECUTES the
importer. Measured 2026-09-19: `6c6ca2ee` privatised `is_checkout` and deleted
`worktree_fixture` while reworking that module's own arms, updating the seven
in-module callers and neither of the two external ones. Both external callers
are **docs-gate CHECKS**, and both died with

    AttributeError: module 'worktree_state' has no attribute 'is_checkout'

for **6h40m** on `develop`. Not a wrong verdict — NO verdict, which is Issue
804's class one seam over: a gate that dies has findings that are not
*unknown* but *unlooked at*.

⛔ **Both names carried a written contract naming their consumers**, and the
contract is the reason this is a gate rather than a style note. `AGENTS.md`
says *"`worktree_state.is_checkout` — **delegate to it too**"*; the deleted
fixture's own docstring said *"Public, because the three delegating consumers
each owe an arm … and that arm needs exactly this fixture."* The document said
the right thing; nothing read it. That is `instrument_reachability_gate`'s
finding one level down — a census over a document cannot enforce the document.

## Why a per-push GATE and not a workstation report

The general instrument already exists and already executes every module:
`arm_reach_gate.py` reports `BASELINE-CRASH` on a module that will not import.
It is kept OUT of the CHECKS set for a measured reason — **157.6s** against the
docs gate's ~13s CPU budget. This pass is static, reads each file once, and
costs ~0.2s over 90 files, so the cheap half of that coverage can ride the
per-push lane while the expensive half stays a workstation verdict.

## Two-sided known answer, which is what makes it shippable

| ref | findings |
|---|---|
| `6c6ca2ee~1` (before the break) | **0** |
| `6c6ca2ee` (after it) | **4** — two names x two consumers, no others |

`--prove-fires` runs exactly that, opt-in on the
`platform_dead_code_floor_gate` precedent: ~1.5s of `git archive` to re-prove
a fact about a frozen commit is worth a workstation run and not a per-push one.

## STATED blind spots, printed on the verdict line

Printed rather than remembered, because a later census that re-derives them
re-derives them wrong (Issue 832's rule, and `shared_temp_path_gate`'s PASS
line is the precedent):

- **`getattr(mod, "name")`** — a dynamic lookup this pass cannot resolve, and
  widening to it would need a constant-folding pass for the second argument.
- **a star-import** in the IMPORTED module: `from x import *` makes its
  top-level namespace un-enumerable from the AST, so such a module is marked
  OPAQUE and nothing is flagged against it. Never silently — the count rides
  the verdict line, because an opaque module is coverage this gate does not
  have.
- **a name bound only inside a function** (`global`), and **`__all__`**, which
  this pass does not read: it constrains `import *`, not attribute access, so
  reading it would narrow the defined set and INVENT findings.
- **runtime breaks that are not name resolution** — a changed signature, a
  moved constant's VALUE. That is Issue 848 T3 and needs an execution, not a
  parse.

Exemptions are pinned by MEMBERSHIP with a REASON per row
(`scripts/cross_module_attr_expected.txt`); a reasonless row is refused and a
row whose site is gone REDS — a pin file that only ever loosens is a backlog
wearing a pin (Issue 785's rule). The file is **deliberately empty**: the
default for a real dangling reference is to fix it or to make the name public,
not to add a row.

    scripts/cross_module_attr_gate.py                  # the verdict, per push
    scripts/cross_module_attr_gate.py --workspace      # the T4 census, exit 0
    scripts/cross_module_attr_gate.py --prove-fires 6c6ca2ee

The arms run UNCONDITIONALLY, behind no flag: `docs_gate.sh` invokes each check
as `"$PY" "$script"` with no arguments, so an arm behind `'--canary' in
sys.argv` never fires on a push (Issue 789's finding).

    """A REPORT (exit 0) — the Issue 848 T4 population, re-derived per run.

    ⛔ **No sweep half, and the measurement is the argument rather than a
    preference.** `check_validation_gate` declined a sweep on a population of
    ONE and was right; `console_encoding_gate` INHERITED that answer and was
    wrong by seven repos. So this was counted, and counting it two ways gives
    two different answers:

    - by FILES, the class looks workspace-wide — 10 of 17 contract repos
      carry tracked `scripts/*.py`, 196 of them.
    - by RESOLVED REFERENCES — the quantity this gate's finding can actually
      come out of — **711 of 747 are in this repo**. riir-train, with 63
      scripts, resolves 32; riir-ai 2; every other repo 0, because their
      `scripts/` are standalone one-offs that import nothing of each other's
      (`instrument_reachability_drift_sweep` measured the same shape from the
      other side: riir-train 61 of 61 unreachable, where the predicate
      over-captures for exactly this reason).

    A sweep would therefore ratchet a bucket that is structurally near-empty,
    and `max_findings = 0` over a population of 36 references in 9 repos is a
    wall nobody can fail. **What would flip the answer is a sibling's
    RESOLVED count growing**, not its file count — which is why this prints
    both, every run, rather than recording either in prose.
