"""Gate: every katgpt-rs shell gate that CAN launder its exit status must not.

The verdict half of `trap_exit_launder_audit.py` (Issue 734 T6), scoped to
this repo. The audit is a report because its top verdict is latent across the
workspace; here the population is two scripts, both repaired, and keeping
them repaired is cheap to assert.

What this gate pins, and why each arm exists:

1. **The detector is not inert.** `selftest()` from the audit must pass
   first. A gate whose classifier silently stopped classifying reports a
   green zero over everything — the failure this repo keeps re-finding
   (`a-green-canary-may-be-inert`). Run the canary before reading the count.

2. **The population is FLOORED, not just checked.** If the classifier breaks
   and derives an empty population, "0 EXPOSED" is a pass. A floor makes the
   instrument going blind a failure instead.

3. **Membership, not cardinality.** The pinned set is the two scripts by
   NAME. A count is not a checksum over a set: dropping `full_gate.sh` from
   the population (someone removes its trap, or the `set -u`) while a new
   script joins keeps the total at 2 and a count-only pin stays green.

4. **Zero UNPARSED.** UNPARSED means the classifier could not read the
   handler body at all (it never closed under brace counting). That is the
   instrument failing, and it is NOT the safe direction: a runaway body
   swallows unrelated `exit 1`s and a late literal flag and can read as a
   false SENTINELLED, which HIDES exposure. It reds here rather than being
   pooled into either column.

5. **Zero PRECAUTIONARY, too — deliberately stricter than the severity.**
   PRECAUTIONARY is nounset WITHOUT errexit: measured, those aborts exit 1
   today, so such a script cannot launder anything and the finding is not
   live. It still reds here, because the distance between PRECAUTIONARY and
   EXPOSED is one character in a `set` line that nobody re-audits when they
   add it, and the fix is one line. The report keeps the two apart so it does
   not over-claim; this gate collapses them because it is a ratchet over two
   files, not a workspace census.

6. **Zero EXPOSED and zero LIVE-FORWARD.** A NEW script that arrives with a
   cleanup trap and no sentinel reds this gate on the commit that adds it —
   which is the whole point, since the seal-remake defect took months to
   surface precisely because nothing objected at the time.

A new script legitimately joining the population is a one-line pin update in
the same commit — the ratchet discipline layers elsewhere in this repo use.
