# Docs gate — the manifest/doc/skill drift assertions, as one command.
# The count is deliberately NOT written here: CHECKS below is the list, and a
# prose count beside a list is the drift this repo keeps rediscovering.
#
# Why this file exists: all three checks already existed, and NOTHING ran any of
# them. Measured 2026-09-01, two of the three were RED on `develop`:
#
#   count_features.py       green, but only because it had just been fixed; it
#                           checked ONE README site out of five and two of 29
#                           manifests.
#   bench_doc_audit.py      exit 1 — a false positive on a doc that correctly
#                           recorded "opt-in ... promoted to DEFAULT-ON".
#   cargo_comment_audit.py  exit 1 — a false positive from a case-SENSITIVE
#                           "Opt-in" regex that missed the repo's 32 "OPT-IN"
#                           comment lines.
#
# An assertion nobody invokes is decoration, and a red one nobody invokes is
# worse: it trains the next reader to assume the tool is broken.
#
# Cost: ~3s total. That is what makes per-push affordable here, in deliberate
# contrast to scripts/full_gate.sh (>13 min, weekly). It was ~556s before the
# manifest walk was pruned — `rglob("Cargo.toml")` descended into target/
# (117 GB, ~1.3M entries) and filtered afterwards, four times per run.
#
# Unlike the full gate this is platform-INDEPENDENT: pure Python over manifests
# and markdown, no cfg(target_os) surface, so ubuntu is correct and macOS would
# only cost more. Don't "fix" it to macos-latest.
#
# WORKSTATION REQUIREMENTS (measured on the partial 4090 box 2026-09-04, where
# 5 of 8 checks red for environment, not drift): (1) python3 >= 3.11 on PATH —
# cfg_gated_target_audit.py imports tomllib (3.10 lacks it; the Windows Store
# python3 alias also shadows real installs); (2) PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 — a
# cp874/cp1252 console cannot print the gates' checkmark output and the failure
# masquerades as a gate failure; (3) a FULL workspace checkout —
# skill_repo_set_gate.py re-derives the live repo set and FAILS on repos the
# box simply has not cloned (10 of 16 here, incl. riir-mmorpg-examples/riir-dao)
# — regenerating repo_set.txt on a partial box would corrupt the canonical set;
# the M3 is the canonical full workstation for that half. Issue 765 (2026-09-13)
# added the explicit marker for known-partial boxes: DOCS_GATE_PARTIAL_CLONE=1
#
# UPDATE 2026-09-13 (4090 session): (1) and (2) are now SELF-SUPPLIED — the
# gate resolves its interpreter by EXECUTION probing python3/python/py and
# prefers the HIGHEST version (a working `python` 3.10 was shadowing `py`
# 3.14; the stub python3 is skipped), warns loudly below 3.11, and exports
# PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 unless the caller set their own. skill_repo_set_gate
# reads UTF-8 with an explicit encoding (a cp874-default read_text() crashed
# the scan). First 17/17 green on the 4090 at that commit; (3) remains the
# one M3-canonical requirement (the deferral rides each population check's
# final line under the marker).
# makes the three population checks (skill_repo_set_gate,
# population_sync_gate, issue_citation_gate) print a loud deferral on the
# population axis instead of a remedy that invites the corruption. Marker-gated,
# never auto-detected — a genuinely-missing sibling still refuses.
#
# skill_repo_set_gate.py (added 2026-09-01, Issue 703) has a second axis the
# other three do not: it reads SIBLING repos, which CI does not have. It does
# NOT skip there — it separates its VOCABULARY (committed snapshot,
# scripts/repo_set.txt) from its POPULATION (the SKILL.md it can actually see),
# prints both, and the workstation run re-derives the snapshot and FAILS on
# drift. So CI checks this repo's 8 skills against all 18 repo names, and says
# out loud that it saw 8 of 12. A gate that skipped instead would be the
# vacuous green it exists to catch.
#
# cfg_gated_floor_gate.py (added 2026-09-03, Issue 713) is katgpt-rs-SCOPED on
# purpose, unlike the sibling-reading check above it. Its instrument
# (cfg_gated_target_audit.py) audits any repo, but CI has a single checkout, so
# a cross-repo version would derive an empty population and print a confident
# green over zero repos — the same defect it exists to catch, which is also why
# docs_drift_sweep.py is deliberately absent from CHECKS. Sibling coverage is
# Issue 713 T3, an owner call per repo. Its pins are two-sided (two ceilings +
# two blindness floors) because a ceiling cannot fail once the auditor goes
# blind and reports zero; see scripts/cfg_gated_floors.txt.
#
# orphaned_attr_gate.py (added 2026-09-03) is pinned at ZERO offenders: the
# shape it forbids -- an OUTER #[cfg] separated from its item by a blank line,
# which Rust still binds to that item -- measured zero sites across every
# contract repo at the fix (19 then; re-measured 2026-09-04 over the live 16,
# still zero everywhere). It exists because that shape sat in katgpt-pruners for
# two days and broke every RELEASE build of `sdar_gate` (26d055c6 -> a08376a0),
# while the commit that introduced it validated in debug and reported 597/0.
#
# It DOES have floors, added 2026-09-04, and the paragraph above is why: a zero
# ceiling cannot fail once the walk goes blind. The reasoning was written here
# for docs_drift_sweep.py and not applied to the check three lines below it.
# Two population floors (.rs files, outer-#[cfg] sites), katgpt-rs-scoped --
# riir-viewbridge has 24 .rs files against this repo's 2,418, so a shared floor
# would red every small sibling forever. The same commit stopped its PASS line
# printing "measured 0 across 19 repos", a cross-repo claim no single-repo run
# had made, two lines under the repo-set gate correctly saying 16.
#
# Runs every check even after one fails — the same reason full_gate.sh passes
# --keep-going: stopping at the first failure under-reports the drift.

Three exclusions a naive grep gets wrong — wasm32/simd128 (no runtime detection there, so a compile-time gate is the only option), NEON (implied by the arch), and the runtime probe's own body, which is the same attribute doing the opposite job. The key is line-free and resolved by brace counting, the two cases needing opposite lookups — an attribute inside a body belongs to its enclosing fn, one ON an item to the NEXT.

    "scripts/timed_region_guard_gate.py:a latency ceiling with no loud-zero defence — rustc + fat LTO deletes a timed loop whose result is dead, so the bar is satisfied by **absent work** and passes with MAXIMUM margin. This is the \`#![cfg]\` green-zero rule one layer down, and worse: the assertion RUNS, so the output is a plausible number rather than a zero count and no count floor can see it. ⛔ Not reasoned about — **executed**: all 34 asserting regions at n ≥ 1000 were run and **7 were satisfied by absent work** (20.6%), two of them GOAT gates, one printing \`Speedup: 8657.9×\`, one printing a well-formed \`0.00x\` because only the NUMERATOR vanished. ⚠ The static predicate Issue 855 T4 proposed is REFUTED by that run — \`let _ =\` vanished **3 of 15** against **4 of 19** for the rest, i.e. the base rate wearing a grep; the column that separates is \`black_box\`, **7 of 23** without it against **0 of 11** with. So the gate does not predict which region is broken; it gates the decidable thing — *is there a loud-zero defence at all*. ⛔ Two tiers, and the split is the honest part: a LITERAL loop bound is the population that was READ end to end (membership wall, one MEASURED number per row), while a bound needing one hop of resolution is real and **unread** (a ratchet on the derivative — pinning an unread bucket by name is Issue 785's forbidden shape). One hop is not optional: T1's own two founding specimens are \`let n = 100_000; for _ in 0..n\`, so a literal-only predicate would have shipped the class it was written for. ⚠ It does NOT claim a pinned region is safe — \`black_box\` is the weakest of three defences (result, **arguments**, **receiver**) and two arms vanished carrying one (Issue 855 T4)"

# ── Does `times` account for these children AT ALL? (Issue 792) ─────────────
# The ~0 guard below catches a number destroyed by a fork. It does NOT catch
# the other way this figure stops being a measurement, because that one prints
# a well-formed, plausible-looking value: on Windows/MSYS, `times` accounts for
# MSYS children and reports essentially NOTHING for native (non-MSYS) ones.
# Measured 2026-09-14 on this workspace's Windows box, one child at a time,
# each burning ~2s of CPU:
#     bash -c 'while ...'               -> children 1.796s user 0.468s sys  ✓
#     py -c '...'                       -> children 0.000s user 0.015s sys  ✗
#     <python.exe by absolute path>     -> children 0.000s user 0.045s sys  ✗
# So it is the MSYS/native boundary, NOT the `py` launcher shim — resolving a
# real executable does not recover it. The gate printed 1.26s CPU against a
# 19.7s wall and the ~0 guard stayed quiet, while AGENTS.md instructs the
# reader to cite exactly that figure.
#
# A ratio against the wall clock cannot separate the two (this gate's own
# history is 12.65s CPU on a 299.1s wall — 4%, legitimately), so the
# instrument proves itself instead: burn a KNOWN amount of CPU in a child and
# check whether `times` saw it. An unaccounted platform gets a refusal, never
