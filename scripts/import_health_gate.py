"""A tracked `scripts/*.py` that does not IMPORT — Issue 848 T3.

`cross_module_attr_gate.py` (848 T2) is the static half: it resolves every
sibling-module attribute against that module's top-level names. It cannot
reach anything that is not name resolution — a circular import, a missing
third-party dependency, a `raise` in top-level code — because those need an
EXECUTION.

The instrument that does execute every module is `arm_reach_gate.py`, whose
`BASELINE-CRASH` bucket is exactly this failure. It is a **157.6s workstation
verdict** and is deliberately not a CHECK. This gate is the cheap half of that
coverage: import each module once, report which ones die.

## Affordable — measured, and the measurement found its own blocker

Over the 86 tracked top-level modules, one interpreter, each imported in turn:

    total 6.34s
      6.238s  list_unresolved_percentile_sites
      0.015s  all_ignored_target_audit
      0.10s   everything else, all 85 of them

**98% of the lane was one module** whose entire body was top-level — no
`main()`, no `__main__` guard — so importing it ran a workspace-wide `.rs`
walk and printed to stdout. Guarded in the same change (and `arm_reach_gate`
had been paying that 6.2s once per mutant). The lane is ~0.1s of import plus
one interpreter start.

⛔ **A per-module subprocess was measured too and is NOT worth 3x the cost.**
One process per module is 10.28s against 7.52s for one process importing all
86, and both reported the **identical** single failure. So this runs them in
ONE child, and the cost of that choice is STATED rather than hidden: a module
already imported as somebody else's dependency is cached, so its top-level
code runs once, and a failure caused by a previous import's side effects
would be attributed to the wrong module. Both are acceptable for a predicate
that asks only *does this import at all*; neither is acceptable silently.

## What it does NOT claim

- **not that the module WORKS** — only that `import` completes. A wrong
  constant, a broken predicate and a changed signature all import fine. That
  is `arm_reach_gate`'s question and it stays a workstation verdict.
- **not that a name used at CALL time exists** — that is 848 T2's gate, and
  the 6h40m incident it was written for was exactly that shape. The two are
  complementary and must not be pooled: this one executes and sees little,
  that one parses and sees names everywhere.
- **not a third-party dependency audit.** A module needing `numpy` on a box
  without it is an ENVIRONMENT fact, not a defect, and it is pinned by name
  with a reason rather than being allowed to red every run.

Exemptions are pinned by MEMBERSHIP with a REASON per row
(`scripts/import_health_expected.txt`); a reasonless row is refused, and a row
whose module imports again REDS — a pin file that only ever loosens is a
backlog wearing a pin (Issue 785's rule).

    scripts/import_health_gate.py       # the verdict, per push
    scripts/import_health_gate.py -v    # per-module timings, slowest first

The arms run UNCONDITIONALLY, behind no flag: `docs_gate.sh` invokes each
check as `"$PY" "$script"` with no arguments (Issue 789's finding).
