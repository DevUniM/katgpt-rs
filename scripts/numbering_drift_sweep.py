"""Run the numbering gate's checks over EVERY contract repo, not just this one.

`scripts/numbering_gate.py` is katgpt-rs-scoped by construction: its pins live
in `scripts/numbering_floors.txt`, which says "katgpt-rs scope only" in its
first line, and `docs_gate.yml` has a single checkout so it could never see a
sibling. That is the right shape for a per-push CI gate and the wrong shape for
the question "is anyone else allocating numbers twice?" — which nothing had
ever asked. Measured the first time it was asked (2026-09-05):

    32 tracked duplicate numbers across 4 sibling repos, in ALLOCATOR-SERIAL
    directories, while katgpt-rs — the one repo with a gate — had zero.
     5 `.highwater` files that are not integers at all, every one of them
       `echo -n <N> > .highwater` writing its own flag into the file, which
       DISARMS the above-highwater check for that directory (Issue 725).

This is the same shape as Issue 702 one instrument over: an auditor that
accepts a repo path, pointed at exactly one repo for months, so a sibling with
the defect is indistinguishable from a sibling nobody looked at.

Why this is NOT in scripts/docs_gate.sh's CHECKS
------------------------------------------------
Identical reasoning to scripts/docs_drift_sweep.py: CI has one checkout, the
siblings are private and simply absent, so this would either red on every run
or derive an empty population and print a confident green over zero repos.

    this script              workstation, on demand, every contract repo
    numbering_gate.py        CI, per-push (docs_gate.sh), katgpt-rs only

Vocabulary vs population
------------------------
The population (which repos exist) is DERIVED — BOUNDARY.md + a `.git` dir,
never typed, per Issue 703. The expectations are COMMITTED, in
`scripts/numbering_drift_floors.txt`, because deriving both from one walk is
what makes a cross-repo gate permanently green.

Ceilings here are a RATCHET, not a wall. 32 duplicates exist today across repos
this session does not own; resolving one is a citation-weight arbitration
(Issue 724 T2's precedent: the file with 27 inbound mentions keeps the number,
the other moves), not a rename. So each repo's ceiling is pinned at its
MEASURED count: a new collision reds immediately, and the standing backlog is
visible in the pins rather than silently tolerated. Lower a pin in the commit
that resolves a collision.

Scope, which is the load-bearing decision
-----------------------------------------
Duplicate + above-highwater checks run ONLY over allocator-serial directories
(`.plans/.issues/.research/.proposals`). `.benchmarks/` and `.docs/` are
excluded for exactly the reason numbering_floors.txt gives: there the leading
number is the OWNING plan/issue and a family per owner is the intended
convention, so "duplicate" is not decidable without knowing which convention a
given file follows — and a gate must not guess.

The MALFORMED check runs over every numbered directory including those two,
because a file that is not an integer is undecidable under no convention.

Report + gate. Exit 0 clean, 1 on drift above the pins, **2 if the instrument
itself is untrustworthy** (selftest failure) — an unreliable instrument is not
the same finding as drift and must not be reported as one.

The counter-transition classes (Issues 769 + 770, landed 2026-09-13)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
`.highwater` is not only checked for CONTENT (malformed / above-max) but for
HISTORY: `highwater_contiguity_audit.py`'s walker classifies every commit
that touched the counter against ITS OWN PARENTS' blob values (the Issue-770
repair — the 769 walker ordered all refs' hunks by commit DATE, which
manufactured phantom resets from lineage interleaving and could not see
MERGE commits at all; `git log -p` emits no merge diffs). Two classes are
verdicts here —

  resets     a commit (or merge resolution) whose counter value is below
             max(parent values). After `517→511` the re-climb re-spends
             numbers — the never-reuse rule broken by construction, the
             `.issues/121` collision class at counter granularity. Each row
             names the commit that DID it (merge commits included — a merge
             taking the lower side IS the hazard). First corrected
             adjudication (Issue 770): 27 resets workspace-wide, a mix of
             stale-lineage writebacks and merge resolutions taking the lower
             side; historical hazard absorbed by gap fast-forwards and
             push-wins renumbers; the max_dup column proves no live file
             duplicates. Pinned at the MEASURED count per repo — a NEW reset
             reds immediately, the standing history stays visible in the pins.
  unbumped   the WORKTREE counter sits below its committed history max on
             HEAD — a checkout/branch state, not a commit. REPORT-ONLY,
             deliberately unpinned (Issue 770 finding 4): the quantity is a
             function of which branch the box carries (mmorpg-editor's
             bevy worktree vs other refs' 194), so a pin would be ref-set
             dependent and red on a box that owes nothing — the class the
             AGENTS.md "a verdict the box can invalidate should refuse" law
             assigns to printing, never gating.

Both run over EVERY dir carrying a `.highwater`, not just SERIAL_DIRS — a
backward move is anomalous under number- and count-based conventions alike
(the malformed check's precedent). HEAD-reachable only, never --all: pins
must be a function of the branch the box carries, not of which refs happen
to be fetched.
