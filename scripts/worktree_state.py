"""A sweep reads the WORKTREE, so a finding may exist in NO commit — ONE copy.

Issue 797. Every instrument in the cross-repo sweep family walks the working
tree. This workspace runs five-plus concurrent agent sessions against SHARED
worktrees — `staged_set_audit.py` exists for exactly that hazard one axis over
— so a row a sweep prints may sit on a line no commit contains, and a repo a
sweep calls clean may be clean only because somebody's uncommitted edit removed
the offending line.

Measured 2026-09-15, `citation_drift_sweep.audit()` run twice per dirty repo
(worktree, then every dirty in-scope document replaced by its HEAD blob): the
workspace's **entire** standing CROSS finding — 1 of 1 — was an artifact of an
uncommitted edit that stripped a `riir-train` qualifier HEAD carries. It had
already cost a session, carried across a context boundary as backlog reading
"blocked, that session has HISTORY.md uncommitted". The correct verdict was
not *blocked*; it was **there is nothing to fix**, and no amount of reading the
sweep's own output could say which.

Three verdicts, never interchangeable:

- **COMMITTED** — the finding's file matches HEAD. An ordinary finding:
  counted, pinnable, somebody's to repair.
- **UNCOMMITTED** — the file differs from HEAD, so the row may exist in no
  commit. **Displayed** (it is what the file says today, and hiding it would be
  its own lie) but **never adjudicated against a pin** — a ceiling breached by
  somebody's in-flight edit is a red nobody can repair, and a ceiling re-pinned
  from one bakes that edit into a tracked expectations file, where it reds on
  every other box. The split of responsibility, once: the DISPLAY reads the
  worktree, the PINS read HEAD.
- **MASKED** — HEAD carries a row the worktree does not. A *false green*: the
  defect is committed, in the repo, and the sweep says the repo is clean. This
  is the silent direction and therefore the worse one. Measured 0 today, which
  is a measurement and not an absence of the class.

The POPULATION moves too, which a row-level read alone misses: the same two
runs put `n_cites` at **601 (worktree) vs 607 (HEAD)**, because the other
session's uncommitted deletion of a 30-line block took six citations out of the
denominator. A floor re-pinned from such a run is wrong everywhere else.

⚠ **ADVISORY, never a failure.** A sweep that hard-reds on an ordinary dirty
worktree is a sweep nobody runs — the cries-wolf outcome AGENTS.md names for
`.benchmarks/` in the numbering gate. The advisory rides the sweep's FINAL line
in BOTH directions (the `DEFERRED` precedent in `sweep_population.py`: a notice
printed only on failure is one nobody reads on the run that passes), and it is
SILENT when nothing dirty intersects the sweep's own population — a banner that
prints on every run is a banner nobody reads either.

Self-test: `scripts/worktree_state.py` (exit 1 on failure). Every arm is
two-sided where two sides exist — an arm whose perturbation reds nothing
certifies nothing (`platform_dead_code_audit.py`'s first `vendor/` arm).

    ⛔ This is NOT the contract-repo predicate and the two must not be
    interchanged. `.git` answers two different questions in this workspace and
    each spelling is wrong for the other one:

    - *Is this a canonical REPO?* → `.is_dir()`. A `git worktree` has a `.git`
      **FILE**, and counting one as a repo attributes its manifests to a repo
      that does not exist (Issue 835 defect 1). That predicate is
      `skill_repo_set_gate.derive_repos`; never re-derive it here.
    - *Can I run git rooted here?* → `.exists()`, this function. A worktree is
      a perfectly good checkout, and `.is_dir()` silently says otherwise.

    All five guards below took `.is_dir()`, and every one of their false
    branches returns the value meaning *nothing to report* — so in a worktree
    the whole head-provenance mechanism went inert with no signal anywhere,
    and a sweep re-pinned from another session's in-flight edits believing it
    had read HEAD. That is Issue 797's founding defect, reintroduced inside
    the mechanism built to prevent it.

    The requirement this probe actually exists for is unaffected, and it is
    asserted one arm group down: `git -C` walks UP, so a non-repo directory
    nested inside a repo must not inherit its PARENT's answers. Such a
    directory has no `.git` entry of ANY kind, so `.exists()` protects it
    exactly as `.is_dir()` did — as does a `git archive` extraction, which
    stays clean-by-construction rather than an error. The change is strictly

    Issue 822 T2. `split_rows` above answers half the question — it withholds
    the rows whose file is dirty — and a sweep that stops there can only ever
    report *fewer* findings than it has. It cannot see MASKED (HEAD carries a
    row the worktree hides: a committed defect reported clean, the silent
    direction), and it withholds a row that HEAD carries too, which understates
    the number the pins are supposed to adjudicate. `citation_drift_sweep` gets
    the full three-way answer by re-running its ENTIRE classifier with an
    injected reader; this is that pattern, once, for the other thirteen.

    ⚠ **THE PREMISE IS PER-FILE ROW INDEPENDENCE**, and it is what makes this
    affordable. A row's existence must depend only on its OWN file's bytes —
    then every clean file's rows are identical at HEAD by construction, and the
    only files that need re-reading are the dirty ones IN this sweep's own
    population. Issue 822 T2 asked whether re-reading is affordable for a
    2415-file Rust walk; the answer is that the question was the wrong shape.
    The cost is |dirty ∩ population| `git show` calls — the quantity
    `dirty_in_scope()` already prints on the advisory line, typically 0 and
    measured in this workspace at a handful. A tree-sized re-walk buys nothing.

    ⛔ So a CROSS-FILE classifier must NOT use this: `len_derived` resolves a
    caller's provenance through other files (and other repos),
    `instrument_reachability` computes a closure from roots, `numbering` and
    `citation` are cross-document by construction. For those the whole-run
    re-classification with an injected `read` is the correct instrument and
    this shortcut would invent verdicts. The premise is a property of the
    CALLER's classifier, which no check here can decide — so it is stated, not
    asserted.

    `rescan(rel, head_src)` re-classifies ONE file from HEAD's bytes and
    returns that file's rows. `head_src` is None when the path is absent from
    HEAD (a STAGED-but-never-committed file — the measured case: Issue 822's
    breach included a row on a file `git log` cannot see at all), and a caller
    must answer None with no rows rather than crash.

    `key_of(row)` must be LINE-FREE for the same reason `citation_drift_sweep`'s
    is: any edit above a finding shifts its line, so a line-bearing key reports
    every row in an edited file as UNCOMMITTED *and* MASKED at once.

      and a caller that cannot distinguish it from empty text will classify
      another session's in-flight file as a committed finding. `in` and
      `.get()` say different things here; use `in`.
    - **An EMPTY dict means skip the second classification entirely**, not
      "overlay nothing". A sweep that re-runs its classifier unconditionally
      doubles its cost on every clean run, which is how a helper stops being
      called.
    - The patterns must name every file that can CHANGE a verdict, not just
      the ones findings sit on. For a closure that is the roots as well.
    - `dirty_files` excludes untracked files, so an untracked script cannot

    """A throwaway CHECKOUT of HEAD, or `None` when nothing in scope is dirty.

    Issue 822 T5g — the third instrument, for classifiers the other two cannot
    reach. `head_delta` substitutes one file's bytes; `head_overlay` hands a
    whole-run re-classification `{rel: bytes}`. Both assume the classifier
    takes its text from ONE place a caller can intercept. Measured on
    `wasm32_surface_audit`, that assumption fails: it shells out to `git grep`
    for the walk, `git ls-files` twice for the manifests and the lane rows, and
    reads files directly besides — four seams, and an overlay that misses any
    one of them produces a verdict built half from HEAD and half from the
    worktree, which is worse than either.

    So this materialises HEAD instead and lets the classifier run unmodified:
    `git archive HEAD`, extracted, then `git init` + `git add -A -f` so the
    tree answers `git grep` and `git ls-files` exactly as a real checkout does.
    `-f` is load-bearing — an extracted `.gitignore` would otherwise exclude
    content HEAD tracks, and `git archive` emits tracked content only, so
    everything in it belongs in the index by construction. No commit is made
    (`pipefail_discard_drift_sweep._temp_repo`'s precedent: `git grep` reads
    the index, and a commit buys nothing).

    ⚠ It is the EXPENSIVE one — a tree copy rather than a handful of `git
    show` calls — so it yields `None` on a clean run and the caller must skip
    its second classification entirely, exactly as an empty overlay means
    SKIP. `None` also covers "not a git repository" and an archive that
    failed: in both the honest answer is that this run has nothing committed
    to compare against, never a fabricated empty tree, which would report
    every finding as UNCOMMITTED.

    `paths` — optional git PATHSPECS narrowing what the archive carries, and
    the difference is not marginal. Measured on riir-train (T5j): the whole
    tree is **604 MB / 2.1s to archive and 1.0s to extract**, against **30.6 MB
    / 0.13s / 0.37s** for `'*.rs' '*.toml'`, and the `git add -A` underneath
    scales with the same file count — one dirty file took a 1.9s sweep to
    **36.6s** unnarrowed.

    ⛔ **The narrowing is the caller's RISK, not a tuning knob, and it is the
    same hazard as an overlay that misses a seam.** A file HEAD carries and the
    pathspec drops is ABSENT from the tree, so a classifier that reads it
    silently classifies against a tree that never existed — and unlike a
    missing overlay entry there is no `None` to notice. Pass paths only where
    the classifier's inputs are ENUMERABLE (a manifest+source join is;
    anything reaching `git grep` over the whole tree is not), and state them
    from the same constant the sweep's SCOPE comes from. The default is the
    whole tree, which is always correct.

    `extra_dirty` — paths that must count as dirt even though `git status` does
    not report them. ⛔ It exists for ONE measured shape: a sweep whose WALK
    includes UNTRACKED files. `dirty_files` excludes untracked by design ("a
    sweep's population is what git tracks", Issue 777) and that is right for
    every caller whose walk is `git ls-files` — but `restatement_theorem_audit`
    uses `os.walk`, so an untracked `.lean` is IN its population, is in no
    commit by definition, and produces zero `git status` dirt. Without this the
    trigger never fires, no HEAD exists to compare against, and the row is
    filed COMMITTED: Issue 822's defect in its purest form, which
    `markdown_fence` had to split by hand one instrument over. Nothing here
    needs the paths to exist or to be read — they only widen the trigger, and
    the tree itself is still HEAD, where an untracked file correctly does not
    appear.

    Issue 798. The dirty-vs-HEAD axis above compares the worktree to LOCAL
    HEAD, so it is blind to a checkout that matches its own HEAD and is 109
    commits behind origin — and a sweep reads the WORKTREE. Measured: riir-ai's
    `toolchain-override-deliberate` marker was committed upstream at
    `194cdc9b5` while this box's riir-ai sat 109 commits back, so the sweep
    reported `drift 1 · ✗ FAILED` on a defect that was already FIXED. That is

    is a committed FIX read dirty.

    at all — `ci_gate_coverage.py`'s standing finding).
