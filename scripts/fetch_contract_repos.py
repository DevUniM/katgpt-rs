"""Refresh every contract repo's remote-tracking refs, once (Issue 850 T2).

## Why this is a SESSION instrument and not a sweep flag

`worktree_state.behind_origin()` compares HEAD to a **local** remote-tracking
ref, so every staleness verdict in the sweep family is only as fresh as the
last fetch. Issue 827 T5 and Issue 850 T1/T3 made that honest: a silent
reading resting on a ref older than `STALE_FETCH_HOURS` is now disclosed as
`UNVERIFIED UPSTREAM` rather than believed. Issue 850 T2 asks the next
question — should a sweep just FETCH? — and warns against answering it by
reflex.

**Measured 2026-09-19 over the 17 contract repos on this box: 250.2s
serial, 50.2s at 8-way parallelism, 0 failures.** Against that, a sweep in
this family costs 0.04-40s and the whole 32-check docs gate costs ~164s wall.
So a per-sweep fetch is **5-30x the cost of the thing it precedes**, and a
full family run would pay it ~19 times. That is the empirical half of the
answer, and it is decisive on its own.

The design half is separate and points the same way. A fetch WRITES
remote-tracking refs in repos other sessions own. It cannot break a build
(refs/remotes is neither HEAD nor the worktree), but it can change a
concurrently-running instrument's verdict mid-run — Issue 797's class with
the sweep as the perpetrator rather than the victim. It also makes a verdict
depend on the network, and this box has a recorded ssh-transport failure mode;
a sweep that cannot answer offline is a sweep that stops being run.

⛔ **And a `--fetch` flag on each sweep is not the repair either** — Issue 850
T2 says so in advance: a flag nobody passes is not a repair. Freshness is a
property of the BOX at a moment, not of any one sweep. So it is fetched ONCE,
here, and the sweeps stay observers that DISCLOSE.

## The defect this actually fixes, which is not the cost

The advisory's remedy text reads *"`git fetch` in the named repo before
trusting it"*, and it names repos by their **CONTRACT** spelling — correctly,
because `repo_alias`'s own rule is that machine-local alias content must never
reach stdout (run logs get pasted into tracked docs). On an aliased box those
names are directories that **DO NOT EXIST**: measured here, the advisory tells
the reader to fetch `mmorpg-editor`, `mmorpg-remake` and `mmorpg-remaster`
while the checkouts are `seal-game-editor`, `seal-remake` and
`seal-online-remaster`.

Both halves of that are right and the remedy is still unusable, which is why
the fix is a command that resolves the codec ITSELF rather than a path the
reader has to translate. That is the whole argument for this file existing.

## What it does NOT do

- It does not merge, rebase, checkout or touch a working tree. `git fetch`
  only, `origin` NAMED — riir-chain carries a second remote (`github`) that is
  stale by design, and a bare `git fetch` there would update a ref nothing
  reads.
- It does not decide whether a repo SHOULD be fetched. Every contract repo on
  the box is refreshed; a repo with no `origin` is reported, never guessed at.
- It is not a gate. Exit 1 on a fetch FAILURE (actionable — network, auth,
  a dead transport) and 0 otherwise, including when nothing moved.
