"""A `path = "../X"` dependency on a repo NOBODY HAS — Issue 835.

riir-clippy `fbf698e6` added `riir-llm = { path = "../riir-llm", optional =
true }`. That repo existed on exactly one box. Every cargo command in
riir-clippy then died at manifest load:

    failed to load source for dependency `riir-llm`
      Caused by: failed to read `E:\\git\\riir-llm\\Cargo.toml`

⛔ **`optional = true` does not save you.** Cargo resolves path dependencies to
read their package metadata regardless of whether any feature enables them, so
this is not a feature you can switch off — the crate is simply unbuildable,
including `cargo check`, `cargo test` and `cargo fmt`.

## Why nothing caught it, which is the actual finding

The workspace's population checks partition repos two ways:

| state | who notices |
|---|---|
| on disk, absent from `repo_set.txt` | UNREGISTERED — reds in every posture |
| in `repo_set.txt`, absent from disk | UNSEEN, or DEFERRED under `DOCS_GATE_PARTIAL_CLONE` |
| **neither** | **nothing** |

Every predicate either derives from the WALK or compares walk-against-file, so
a repo in neither set is not a bucket anybody is lenient about — **it is not a
bucket at all.** Meanwhile it breaks the build of a repo that IS registered.

⚠ The REPAIR path was fully instrumented; only DISCOVERY was not. When the
repo was cloned and registered, `agents_repo_set_gate` immediately went to
26/27 on two independent signals (a `repo_set.txt` row AGENTS.md did not name,
and a count mismatch) — and said in its own message that a matching count
would prove nothing. This gate closes the other end.

## The verdicts

- **RESOLVED** — the target directory exists.
- **DEFERRED** — the target's repo is absent from this box but PRESENT in
  `repo_set.txt`, and `DOCS_GATE_PARTIAL_CLONE=1` is set. The seven canonical
  repos this workstation does not carry are exactly this case, and without the
  distinction the gate would be unrunnable on any partial box.
- ⛔ **ORPHAN** — the target's repo is absent from disk **and** absent from
  `repo_set.txt`. The class. Walled at **0**.
- ⛔ **BROKEN-SUBPATH** — the repo is present but the crate directory under it
  is not. An ordinary broken dep, walled at 0 too; kept as its own verdict
  because the remedy is completely different (fix the path, not clone a repo).

`DOCS_GATE_CI=1` defers the whole cross-repo axis: a single-checkout CI job
would call every dep unresolvable and print a confident red.

## What it does NOT claim

That a resolvable dep is CORRECT — only that something is there. Version
skew, a stale sibling, and a dep pointing at the wrong crate all resolve.
