"""Run both doc-drift auditors over EVERY contract repo, not just this one.

Issue 702's finding, in one sentence: the auditors accept a repo path and audit
any repo, and for months nothing pointed them at anything but katgpt-rs. A
sibling with stale labels is indistinguishable from a sibling nobody looked at.
This script is the workstation instrument that looks at all of them at once —
the answer had been recomputed by hand three times before it was written down.

Why this is NOT in scripts/docs_gate.sh's CHECKS array
------------------------------------------------------
docs_gate.yml runs on ubuntu-latest with a single checkout. The siblings are
private and simply are not there, so this check would either fail on every CI
run or — far worse — derive an empty population and print a confident green
over zero repos. Cadence is deliberately split:

  this script            workstation, on demand, every contract repo (derived)
  docs_gate.yml          CI, per-push, katgpt-rs only
  sibling_docs_drift.yml CI, reusable, one sibling per caller

Vocabulary vs population (the trap this script is built around)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The population — which repos exist — is DERIVED (BOUNDARY.md + a .git dir),
never typed; a hand-typed repo set is Issue 703. But deriving the *expectations*
from the same walk would make the gate permanently green: a repo that vanished,
or an auditor that went blind to a whole dialect, both just shrink the walk and
still report "0 mismatches". So the expectations are COMMITTED, in
scripts/docs_drift_floors.txt, and this script fails on a repo that is in the
floor file and absent or under-count in the walk.

The floors are PRESENCE, not the observed count, and the reasoning for that
lives in docs_drift_floors.txt's header — in short: exact counts would duplicate
bench_doc_audit.py's selftest() (a stronger, already-canaried blindness
detector) while redding on every legitimate doc removal. The assertion this
sweep is uniquely able to make is "a repo known to bear labels was actually
SEEN", which selftest() cannot make because it never leaves this repo.

Floors are a MINIMUM, so adding docs never reds this gate. If a repo
legitimately stops carrying labels, drop its row in the same commit — the
failure message says so, because a gate whose red is ambiguous gets ignored.

    `> row["max_*"]` comparison in the family, and this sweep's ceiling is not

    N paths, so the HEAD pass costs one extra invocation rather than one per
    repo.
