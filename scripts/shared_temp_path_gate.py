"""A test wrote to a FIXED `env::temp_dir()` path, so two processes truncate it (Issue 832).

`std::env::temp_dir().join("fixed_name.bin")` is safe against other tests in
the same binary — each site has its own filename — and NOT safe against another
PROCESS running the same test. This workspace runs 5+ concurrent agent sessions
against shared worktrees, and its own instruments overlap by design: `test_gate`,
`full_gate`, `x86_64_execution_matrix` and any hand-run `cargo test` each get
their own target dir and all share ONE system temp directory. `create`
truncates, so A writes, B truncates, A reads back zero bytes.

Measured (Issue 832, 2026-09-18):

- `pruners::bomber::replay::tests::writer_writes_and_counts_samples` reproduced
  on demand — two concurrent copies of one binary, 1 failure in 24 runs, and
  byte-identical to the x86_64 matrix's cell-5 red. Alone it passes every time.
- Five `katgpt-types::tests_types` tests failed AT ONCE with "File too small for
  header", across five DIFFERENT filenames — another test binary truncating all
  five.

⛔ The reason this is a GATE and not a sweep-and-done: 13 sites in this
workspace already carried the unique-path form
(`katgpt-transformer/src/contiguous.rs`, `katgpt-core/src/content_store/fetcher.rs`,
the three `katgpt-pruners` sites) and 27 did not — 25 repaired, 2 adjudicated
as deliberate. The rule was known and un-enforced, which is this repo's own
most-repeated shape.

⛔ And the reason it is not covered by "run it again": the x86_64 matrix's
confirm step filed one of these as TRANSIENT — *failed in the cell, PASSED
alone* — which is true and the wrong conclusion. This class passes alone BY
CONSTRUCTION, because alone there is no second process. Re-running separates a
load-sensitive bar from a real regression and says nothing about a concurrency
defect, which is a permanent property of the test.

    scripts/shared_temp_path_gate.py    # the verdict AND the arms

The arms run UNCONDITIONALLY, behind no flag: `docs_gate.sh` invokes each check
as `"$PY" "$script"` with no arguments, so an arm behind `'--canary' in
sys.argv` never fires on a push (Issue 789's finding).

The quantity gated is NOT the count — *a set is gateable where its cardinality
is not*. Membership, both directions: a fixed-path site with no pin row reds,
and a pin row whose site is gone or whose per-(file, literal) count moved reds
STALE, so the file cannot only ever loosen.

The pin key is deliberately LINE-FREE: `relpath::literal::count`. A line number
drifts on every edit above it.

Population: every tracked `*.rs` `env::temp_dir()` immediately `.join`-ed with a
STRING LITERAL. A literal has no runtime discriminator by construction, which is
the whole defect; `join(format!("n_{}", std::process::id()))` is not a literal
and is out of population without needing a second rule.

⚠ STATED BLIND SPOTS — each is a real hole, named so a later census reads this
instead of re-deriving it:

- A `temp_dir()` bound to a variable first (`let base = env::temp_dir(); let p =
  base.join("fixed.bin");`) is NOT seen. The receiver's provenance is not
  tracked.
- Other spellings of "a fixed scratch path" are NOT seen: `PathBuf::from("/tmp/…")`,
  `"./target/test_scratch"`, `TempDir` wrappers. Issue 832 T4 owns measuring
  those before a floor is written for them — a floor over one spelling describes
  one spelling's population.
- `examples/` sites are in population and pinned, not excluded: a demo's temp
  path is meant to stay findable by a human, and that is an adjudication with a
  reason rather than a rule.

The masker blanks comments and RAW strings but KEEPS ordinary string literals —
it has to, because the thing being matched IS a string literal. Raw strings are
blanked because embedded-Rust-source fixtures are a measured class here
(`platform_dead_code_audit`, `wasm32_surface_audit`, `subprocess_encoding_gate`
all met it). A `.join("…")` spelled inside an ordinary escaped string literal
would phantom-match; that direction is a LOUD unpinned red a human resolves,
never a silent green.
