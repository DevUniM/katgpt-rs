r"""A SHIPPED path selecting its fast arm on a COMPILE-time `target_feature`
— Issue 847 T3.

```rust
#[cfg(all(target_arch = "x86_64", target_feature = "avx2"))]   // COMPILE time
{ unsafe { fast_arm(..) } return; }
#[cfg(not(any(target_arch = "aarch64",
              all(target_arch = "x86_64", target_feature = "avx2"))))]
{ scalar_arm(..) }
```

`target_feature = "avx2"` is **off by default on x86_64**, so the fast arm
compiles to nothing on every ordinary build and the dispatcher silently takes
the scalar path. AGENTS.md already documents this shape and **only for
GATES** — *"an arm gated `cfg(all(target_arch = "x86_64", target_feature =
"avx2"))` compiles to nothing without it, and the run then exercises the
scalar fallback and proves nothing."* On a shipped path the cost is latency on
every call, in the configuration everybody builds, and nothing was looking for
it there.

Measured when Issue 847 found it: a default build was giving up **4.4-5.6x**
on `dequant_dot_via_lut` — in a DEFAULT-ON feature — and **2.4-2.5x** on
`f32_to_bf16_rne_into`. The correct form needs no new machinery:
`if simd_level() == SimdLevel::Avx2 { .. }`, a cached CPUID probe
`katgpt-types` already ships, with the kernel gated on the **arch alone**
(its `#[target_feature(enable = ..)]` attribute, not the cfg, is what makes
the intrinsic body compile).

## Three exclusions, each of which a naive grep gets wrong

The task that commissioned this gate names them, and getting one wrong makes
the cries-wolf instrument AGENTS.md warns gets ignored:

- **wasm32 / `simd128`** — that target has no runtime feature detection in
  this workspace, so a compile-time gate is the ONLY option and `full_gate.sh`
  layer 2b already builds both arms. 87 sites, every one correct.
- **aarch64 / NEON** — implied by the arch; there is nothing to detect.
- **the runtime probe's own body** — `#[cfg(target_feature = "avx2")] { true }`
  inside `is_avx2_fma_available()` **is** the correct pattern (a build that
  already has AVX2 need not ask CPUID). Pinned, because it is indistinguishable
  from the defect by any predicate: it is the same attribute doing the opposite
  job.
- **`#[target_feature(enable = ..)]`** is the RIGHT attribute and is never this
  class — it makes a body compile on any build, which is what pairs with a
  runtime probe. 67 sites here.

## Population: this repo. Measured, not inherited.

`check_validation_gate` T4 declined a sweep on a population of ONE and was
right; `console_encoding_gate` INHERITED that answer and was wrong by seven
repos. So it was counted, over the 17 contract repos on the workstation:
**166 `target_feature` cfg attributes in `src/`, ALL 166 in katgpt-rs**, and
zero in every sibling. Re-derive it rather than trusting this paragraph —
`--workspace` prints the table.

Exemptions are pinned by MEMBERSHIP with a REASON per row
(`scripts/shipped_target_feature_expected.txt`); a reasonless row is refused,
and a row whose site is gone REDS. The key is **LINE-FREE** —
`<path>::<enclosing fn>#<ordinal>` — because a line number drifts on every
edit above it and a pin file that reds on noise is one people delete
(`arm_reach_gate`'s recorded rule).

    scripts/shipped_target_feature_gate.py              # the verdict, per push
    scripts/shipped_target_feature_gate.py --workspace  # the population, exit 0
    scripts/shipped_target_feature_gate.py --prove-fires 32056164

The arms run UNCONDITIONALLY, behind no flag: `docs_gate.sh` invokes each check
as `"$PY" "$script"` with no arguments (Issue 789's finding).
